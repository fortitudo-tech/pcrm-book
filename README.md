# Repository for the Portfolio Construction and Risk Management book
This is the development repository for the Portfolio Construction and Risk
Management book, which is only accessible to
[crowdfunding campaign backers](https://igg.me/at/pcrm-book).

# Running the code
It is recommended to install the book's code dependencies in a 
[conda environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html).

After cloning the repository to your local machine, you can install the dependencies
using the following command in your terminal:

    conda env create -f environment.yml

You can then activate the conda environment and start a [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/)
instance using the following commands:

    conda activate pcrm-book
    jupyter lab

If you are completely new to [conda environments](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
and Jupyter notebooks, you can find a lot of information online.

# Feedback and questions
Please post your feedback and questions in the community discussion forum. I
will answer the questions to the best of my capability and try to incorporate
the feedback in the book. See the book preface for some general perspectives
on what the book tries to achieve, and which kind feedback will be considered
appropriate.

# Thank you for your support
Your support makes it possible for this book to be written. The more support
the project receives, the faster and better I will be able to complete it.

Besides your personal monetary support, you can help accelerate the process and
improve the quality by simply publicly sharing your positive experience with the
book and the code, and thereby encourage more people to support the project.

No matter how much economic support this project realistically gets during writing,
it will only be a small fraction of the opportunity costs from writing the book at
expense of consulting investment management clients and subsequently potentially
making it freely available online. Hence, you are encouraged to support it by the
amount that you feel it is worth to you.

If you happen to be among top 10 backers by the time the book is made publicly
available, you will get three months personal access to an institutional-grade
implementation of the framework from this book to really test out your newly
acquired knowledge.

If you are among the top 10 backers or claim one of the campaign backer perks,
you can choose to be recognized in the book's preface as someone who has
significantly contributed to the creation of this book.

# License
While the book is being written, it is under a strict All Rights Reserved
license. You are allowed to clone or download the contents of the repository
to devices that only you have access to.

I have kept the access cost to a practical minimum of â‚¬10, which hopefully
makes it accessible to almost everyone.

If you get knowledge of anyone sharing the contents in other ways, please
let me know.
